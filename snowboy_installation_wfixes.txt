first we need to set up the raspberry pi for basic file editing and copying.
	when the pi is booted for the first time follow the setup 
	and connect to the wifi using the gui after that open and terminal run :
	sudo raspi-config
	this wil open the configurator, now chose 5 intefacing option and then chose 2 to enable ssh
	So one can copy files to the raspberry pi using winscp
	exit the configurator and install a file editor of choise, we will be using vim:
	sudo apt install vim


first step is to install the python sound libraries and sound manager:
	sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio sox libatlas-base-dev

	make sure pyaudio is installed:(this doesn't seem to be needed but it won't harm)
	pip install pyaudio

now we have to configure our audio device.
	using :
	cat /proc/asound/cards 
	you will get an overview of your sound card extra info: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/80072/how-can-i-use-an-external-usb-sound-card-and-set-it-as-default
	Go to /usr/share/alsa and edit the alsa.conf file, this can be done using:
	cd /usr/share/alsa
	sudo vim alsa.conf (or directly by using /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf)
	scroll down and edit the rows
	default.pcm.!card 0
	default.ctl.!card 0
	to the number of your audio device found with the cat command (in our case 2)
	default.pcm.!card 2
	default.ctl.!card 2

	now you should be able to run 
	alsamixer
	and see the channels of your audio, and test the speaker by running:
	speaker-test -c2 -twav
	and test you microphone by running
	rec -c2 test.wav trim 0 3
	This will record 3 second and save it in the folder of where you terminal is at. the file can be played back by:
	play test.wav

We will now install swig which is used to make a python wrapper for snowboy:
	install some extra needed packages:
	sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
	
	first make a folder in which you would like to download swig and install from:
	mkdir /home/pi/Desktop/snowboy
	cd /home/pi/Desktop/snowboy
	
	now from the documentation on the github page of snowboy:
	wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.10.tar.gz
	to unpack the zip file use:
	tar -xvzf swig-3.0.10.tar.gz
	move into the folder:
	cd swig-3.0.10
	
	./configure --prefix=/usr                  \
			--without-clisp                    \
			--without-maximum-compile-warnings 
	(you may need to use sudo for the next commands)
	make
	make install 
	Now have a proper look through the text in the terminal and change the /usr/share/doc/swig-3 
	to the location it was actually installed in, for us it was /usr/share/swig/3.0.10 
	install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/swig-3.0.10 &&
	cp -v -R Doc/* /usr/share/doc/swig-3.0.10
	
	now move out of the folder:
	cd ..
	
now downloading snowboy and making the wrapper	
	copy/clone the github page:
	git clone https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy 
	go into the pithon folder:
	cd snowboy/swig/Python
	make the wrappe:
	make
	this will make various files
	
we can now almost test snowboy.
	make a new folder and copy the files you made above
	also copy the recources folder from the snowboy/snowboy folder
	and copy the snowboydecoder2.py and volume_+_demo_2.py to the folder
	make a word model on the snowboy site and also put in in the file
	you can now run the code using:
	python demo.py your_model.pmdl
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
errors:

	errors saying unknow pcm device then try installing libasound2.dev
	error saying jack server not running or can't be started try "alsactl init"
	error: python: src/hostapi/alsa/pa_linux_alsa.c:3641: PaAlsaStreamComponent_BeginPolling: Assertion `ret == self->nfds' failed
		try installing mplayer using sudo apt install mplayer
		if that doesn't fix it try removing libportaudio2 and (re)installing libasound2-dev
		and install a alsapatch according to (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59006083/how-to-install-portaudio-on-pi-properly/60824906#60824906)
		git clone -b alsapatch https://github.com/gglockner/portaudio
		cd portaudio
		./configure && make
		sudo make install
		sudo ldconfig
		cd .. 
		afterwards installing pyaudio for python
		using 
		pip install pyaudio 
		you can try to use sudo pip3 install pyaudio but i had no luck with it. and some say you should never use sudo when using pip.
